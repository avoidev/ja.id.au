    </aside><p>Coffee is 100% something I cannot live without, I have a few specific coffee I like but to be honest there isn&rsquo;t much I wouldn&rsquo;t consume.</p>
<p>My favourite method at the moment is strong black coffee from my Moka pot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 4 cup version I believe but I got it 2nd hand off eBay so I can&rsquo;t be 100% sure. When I was originally looking for a pot I saw the ubiquitous aluminum versions, however I was always told that drinking from aluminum was always a heath hazard. I know, I know, Italians have been drinking out of these things for eons but this stainless steel ones I ended up getting was just the &lsquo;safer&rsquo; play.</p>
<p>Something I have wanted to try is pour over style coffee, which kind of seems a bit intimidating and very technique heavy. The first time I remembers seeing it is in the anime &ldquo;Tokyo Ghoul&rdquo; however I&rsquo;ve also seen it on a few YouTube videos such as ones from Binging with Babish, and James Hoffman.</p>
<p>Probably another coffee method I&rsquo;ve been exposed to from anime is the existence of canned coffees (Thanks Japan), I&rsquo;ve tried a few from different Asian food importers and I haven&rsquo;t really found any I like. Some are just plain ol&rsquo; black coffee in a can, some are some exotic blends, and other are a vanilla late in a can. All great! However I certainly seem to be leaning towards just long black in a can, Boss is a brand easily accessible in most supermarkets here in Australia.</p>
<h1 id="beans">Beans</h1>
<p>While I haven&rsquo;t experienced the greatest spread of beans, I do have a few ones that stood out to me. One that I have found to be super delish is roast that my Girlfriend got me from a coffee shop in the city &ldquo;Death before Decaf&rdquo; which might I add I think is a dope name for a coffee shop. I haven&rsquo;t been there personally but the shop looks awesome from the pictures on google, and the custard donuts they sell are top 5 imo.</p>
<p>Others I&rsquo;ve got are from just Coles/Woolworths and since I usually opt for a dark roast, they can&rsquo;t really mess up the flavour all that much.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned I want to get into trying pour over coffees, which would generally call for a lighter roast to help expose some more refined and delicate flavours.</p>
<h1 id="current-equipment">Current Equipment</h1>
<p>As previously mentioned my go to is a 4 cup Bialetti stainless steel moka pot. It&rsquo;s a trooper and the replacement gaskets and metal filter only run me like $20, which considering I usually only have to replace it bi-annually is pretty damn good.</p>
<p>Grinder is just so super cheap eBay hand grinder, does the job but once it&rsquo;s dead I&rsquo;ll splash some more cash on something a bit fancier.</p>
<p>Beans are usually stored in re-used Moccona jars. They seem to seal well enough to prevent the coffee from going stale.</p>
