    </header><p>My current engine in my <a href="/posts/my-holden-hz-wagon">wagon</a> is unfortunately running quite poorly. Oil weeps for most seals (rather common in these engines, especially when they’re 40+ yrs old) and also has low compression on the first two cylinders. I use this vehicle as my daily driver (when it behaves) so ideally I would prefer to keep it on the road while I prep another engine however the car has decided otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="current-list-of-issues-with-the-current-motortrans">Current List of Issues with the current motor/trans:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Low compression on cylinders 1 &amp; 2. This could either be a few things.
Leaky head gasket. However oil drains fine and isn’t milky
Valves in the head aren’t seating properly preventing compression
Piston rings aren’t doing what they’re sposed to. (This is my guess as C1 gets a bit oiley at times.</li>
<li>Starter Motor just isn’t having a great time. I’ve know this has been an issue for a while but the excess amp draw kills my battery rather frequently.</li>
<li>Radiator has a mad weep, and the belt driven fan doesn’t cut the mustard when stuck in traffic. Temps easily in the high 90s</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="solution-build-up-a-new-engine--trans">Solution? Build up a new Engine + Trans!</h3>
<p>I bought a running donor motor, another red 202 of similar era, and it also came with 2 addition trimatics and a handful of goodies like alternators, dizzies, carbies, oil pumps etc etc. To give you a money reference for this it all up set me back $1500. Which for mid 2021 Brisbane prices wasn’t half bad. This engine was also a bit sad and in need of a reco but that’s exactly what I wanted to do anyway. Engine was 30tho over on the bore and had a “perform cam” a 35666 from crow cams.</p>
<p>I really wanted to pick me up a Yella Terra head, these were performance heads made my Yella Terra by modifying bog stock cast heads off normal motors. Seem to be rather rare these days for I6s. I managed to snag a half decent one but it was out in Blackbutt which was solid 2-3 hour drive each way from where I live. Picked it up for $500 and unfortunately after picking it up realised it was a 161 head from an earlier model. No sweat though, as it’ll still bolt up fine just needed different pushrods to accommodate.</p>

<p>When spec’ing this engine up I was concerned that the compression ratio would be too high, which to be honest it definitely is but I should still be able to get away with 98OCT at the bowser, more than likely moving this car from a daily to a weekender.</p>
