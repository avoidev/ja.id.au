First I scoured the internet to try and find specs for the Fuel and Temp senders
Fuel is 10 – 70ohms (Full – Empty)
Temp is 10 – 70 ohms (High – Low)

I used a multimeter and the engine temperature probe to measure the temp/resistance of water as it cooled.

I setup the fuel gauge as a linear change in resistance, unlike the variable relationship between temp/resistance. This is a pure guess as I haven’t done any exact measurements of the fuel sender, and couldn’t find any online. However I haven’t be stranded without fuel yet so it can’t be too far out.

I originally intended for this to be a temporary board that was just for testing purposes however it has been inside my car running fairly happy without hiccups for close to 6 months now.
