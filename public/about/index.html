    </header><p>My name is Josh, I&rsquo;m 22 and have a myriad of intrests from food preservation, mechanical thing, electronics and like most kids from the early 2000s an interest in Video Games and Computers. I do have an interest in money and finances, if I were to reskill into a new job it would be something in these fields.</p>
<p>I currently work an IT gig, it&rsquo;s pretty good. Conviently close to home so drive are like 20min each way. However it&rsquo;s only a support gig so don&rsquo;t really get to flex my brain at all.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-decided-to-start-this-webpage">Why I decided to start this webpage.</h1>
<p>Mostly due to a feeling that my life hasn&rsquo;t really meant anything for the last 22 years, and I hope by writing about it and recording things I can do I can use to to convince myself that I&rsquo;m not just doing <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>I also want to reclaim the information I publish. When I first got faceboo, twitter or instagram I dumped everything there. While most people probably have no issue with that I&rsquo;ve developed the throught process that I should really be owning all my data and not just giving it to big data companies.</p>
<p>My current plans involve a few different pages on this website. One for short unrefined thought, one for more planned thoughts, one for an &lsquo;instagram&rsquo; style setup with more images and short dumps of information and the last will me somewhat of a CV thing.</p>
