My name is Josh, I'm 22 and have a myriad of intrests from food preservation, mechanical thing, electronics and like most kids from the early 2000s an interest in Video Games and Computers. I do have an interest in money and finances, if I were to reskill into a new job it would be something in these fields.

I currently work an IT gig, it's pretty good. Conviently close to home so drive are like 20min each way. However it's only a support gig so don't really get to flex my brain at all.

# Why I decided to start this webpage.

Mostly due to a feeling that my life hasn't really meant anything for the last 22 years, and I hope by writing about it and recording things I can do I can use to to convince myself that I'm not just doing *nothing*.

I also want to reclaim the information I publish. When I first got faceboo, twitter or instagram I dumped everything there. While most people probably have no issue with that I've developed the throught process that I should really be owning all my data and not just giving it to big data companies.

My current plans involve a few different pages on this website. One for short unrefined thought, one for more planned thoughts, one for an 'instagram' style setup with more images and short dumps of information and the last will me somewhat of a CV thing.
