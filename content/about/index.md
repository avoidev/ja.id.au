My name is Josh, I'm 22 and have a myriad of interests from food preservation, cars and other mechanical contraptions, electronics and like most kids that grew up in the early 2000s an interest in video games and computers. I do have an interest in money and finances however nothing professionally, this includes tradfi and also crypto finance.

I love myself a beer, and have attempted a few times to brew my own. Other homebrew attempts have included apple cider and mead, I also would be lying if I haven't tried a few 'recipes' from [r/prisonhooch](https://www.reddit.com/r/prisonhooch/).

# Why I decided to start this webpage.

Mostly due to a feeling that my life hasn't really meant anything for the last 22 years, and I hope by writing about it and recording things I can do I can use to to convince myself that I'm not just doing *nothing*.

I also want to reclaim the information I publish. When I first got Facebook, Twitter or Instagram I used to dump everything there. While most people probably have no issue with that I'm now of the opinion that I should really be owning all my data and not just giving it to big data companies.
