My name is Josh, I'm 22 and have a myriad of interests from food preservation, cars and other mechanical contraptions, electronics and like most kids from the early 2000s an interest in video gGames and computers. I do have an interest in money and finances however nothing professionally.

I currently work an IT gig, it's pretty good. Conveniently close to home so drive are like 20min each way. However it's only a support gig so don't really get to flex my brain at all.

# Why I decided to start this webpage.

Mostly due to a feeling that my life hasn't really meant anything for the last 22 years, and I hope by writing about it and recording things I can do I can use to to convince myself that I'm not just doing *nothing*.

I also want to reclaim the information I publish. When I first got Facebook, Twitter or Instagram I dumped everything there. While most people probably have no issue with that I've developed the thought process that I should really be owning all my data and not just giving it to big data companies.
