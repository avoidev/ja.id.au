## Specs:
Engine: 202 Red Motor (Matching numbers üòè)
Transmission: Trimatic (Column Shift)
Differential: Fine spline banjo diff.

### Completed Works
+ Seats have been freshly reupholsters
+ Minor body work repairs, vehicle previously was T-boned in the passenger rear quarter.
+ HEI Dizzy has been fitted from Blue/Black 202, with appropriate coil.
+ ["Custom‚Äù Temp and Fuel Gauges](/post/custom-gauges)

### Todo:
* Engine has weak compression on 2 cylinders (1 and 2). Another engine is currently being built.
* Rust in lower sills need cutting out and repairing.
* Rust in the roof needs addressing.
* Door cards are ‚Äúrotting‚Äù need to replace those. I want to replace the the door cards and rear cargo panels with stamped aluminum ones instead.
* Run new Fuel/Brake lines, custom made full steel pipes. Will have to add distribution block and fuel pressure regulator to accommodate the triple SUs.
* Revisit drivers side passenger footwell panel.
* Stick down carpet better with contact adhesive.
* Fix wiper motor so that it actually has 2 speeds. (Slow and Extra Slow)

## Holden 202 Red Engine Rebuild

My current engine in my [wagon](/posts/my-holden-hz-wagon) is unfortunately running quite poorly. Oil weeps for most seals (rather common in these engines, especially when they‚Äôre 40+ yrs old) and also has low compression on the first two cylinders. I use this vehicle as my daily driver (when it behaves) so ideally I would prefer to keep it on the road while I prep another engine however the car has decided otherwise.

### Current List of Issues with the current motor/trans:

1. Low compression on cylinders 1 & 2. This could either be a few things.
Leaky head gasket. However oil drains fine and isn‚Äôt milky
Valves in the head aren‚Äôt seating properly preventing compression
Piston rings aren‚Äôt doing what they‚Äôre supposed to. (This is my guess as C1 gets a bit oily at times.
2. Starter Motor just isn‚Äôt having a great time. I‚Äôve know this has been an issue for a while but the excess amp draw kills my battery rather frequently.
3. Radiator has a mad weep, and the belt driven fan doesn‚Äôt cut the mustard when stuck in traffic. Temps easily in the high 90s

### Solution? Build up a new Engine + Trans!
I bought a running donor motor, another red 202 of similar era, and it also came with 2 addition trimatics and a handful of goodies like alternators, dizzies, carbies, oil pumps etc etc. To give you a money reference for this it all up set me back $1500. Which for mid 2021 Brisbane prices wasn‚Äôt half bad. This engine was also a bit sad and in need of a reco but that‚Äôs exactly what I wanted to do anyway. Engine was 30tho over on the bore and had a ‚Äúperform cam‚Äù a 35666 from crow cams.

I really wanted to pick me up a YellaTerra head, these were performance heads made my YellaTerra by modifying bog stock cast heads off normal motors. Seem to be rather rare these days for I6s. I managed to snag a half decent one but it was out in Blackbutt which was solid 2-3 hour drive each way from where I live. Picked it up for $500 and unfortunately after picking it up realised it was a 161 head from an earlier model. No sweat though, as it‚Äôll still bolt up fine just needed different pushrods to accommodate.

When spec'ing this engine up I was concerned that the compression ratio would be too high, which to be honest it definitely is but I should still be able to get away with 98OCT at the bowser, more than likely moving this car from a daily to a weekender.

## Custom gauges Fuel and Temp

First I scoured the internet to try and find specs for the Fuel and Temp senders
Fuel is 10 ‚Äì 70ohms (Full ‚Äì Empty)
Temp is 10 ‚Äì 70 ohms (High ‚Äì Low)

I used a multimeter and the engine temperature sender to measure the temp/resistance of water as it cooled. This was a janky setup for sure, but it seems to be super accurate so I cant really complain to be honest. With that data I also used a spreadsheet that utilised Steinhart equation.

Now credit where credits due a video by [Ovens Garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwllQ3LI4qo) on YouTube helped be tons with this and was super helpful. My setup with the sender, multimeter and control temp gauge was all very similar.

I setup the fuel gauge as a linear change in resistance, unlike the variable relationship between temp/resistance. This is a pure guess as I haven‚Äôt done any exact measurements of the fuel sender, and couldn‚Äôt find any online. However I haven‚Äôt be stranded without fuel yet so it can‚Äôt be too far out.

I originally intended for this to be a temporary board that was just for testing purposes however it has been inside my car running fairly happy without hiccups for close to 6 months now. In saying that I do intend to further refine this design and continue adding to it, I also want to design and order some PCBs to make this look way more professional. I'm currently mucking around with EasyEDA which allows me to also seamlessly use JLCPCB for ordering once done.
