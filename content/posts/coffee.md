Coffee is 100% something I cannot live without, I have a few specific coffee I like but to be honest there isn't much I wouldn't consume.

My favourite method at the moment is strong black coffee from my Moka pot.

It's a 4 cup version I believe but I got it 2nd hand off eBay so I can't be 100% sure. When I was originally looking for a pot I saw the ubiquitous aluminum versions, however I was always told that drinking from aluminum was always a heath hazard. I know, I know, Italians have been drinking out of these things for eons but this stainless steel ones I ended up getting was just the 'safer' play.

Something I have wanted to try is pour over style coffee, which kind of seems a bit intimidating and very technique heavy. The first time I remembers seeing it is in the anime "Tokyo Ghoul" however I've also seen it on a few YouTube videos such as ones from Binging with Babish, and James Hoffman.

Probably another coffee method I've been exposed to from anime is the existence of canned coffees (Thanks Japan), I've tried a few from different Asian food importers and I haven't really found any I like. Some are just plain ol' black coffee in a can, some are some exotic blends, and other are a vanilla late in a can. All great! However I certainly seem to be leaning towards just long black in a can, Boss is a brand easily accessible in most supermarkets here in Australia.

# Beans 

While I haven't experienced the greatest spread of beans, I do have a few ones that stood out to me. One that I have found to be super delish is roast that my Girlfriend got me from a coffee shop in the city "Death before Decaf" which might I add I think is a dope name for a coffee shop. I haven't been there personally but the shop looks awesome from the pictures on google, and the custard donuts they sell are top 5 imo.

Others I've got are from just Coles/Woolworths and since I usually opt for a dark roast, they can't really mess up the flavour all that much.

But as I've previously mentioned I want to get into trying pour over coffees, which would generally call for a lighter roast to help expose some more refined and delicate flavours.

# Current Equipment

As previously mentioned my go to is a 4 cup Bialetti stainless steel moka pot. It's a trooper and the replacement gaskets and metal filter only run me like $20, which considering I usually only have to replace it bi-annually is pretty damn good.

Grinder is just so super cheap eBay hand grinder, does the job but once it's dead I'll splash some more cash on something a bit fancier.

Beans are usually stored in re-used Moccona jars. They seem to seal well enough to prevent the coffee from going stale.
