I am rather fond of music.

I like listening to music on Spotify, however to be honest my favorite way to play music is without a doubt physical media. CD, Vinyl and Cassettes. 

Which for a guy that works in tech and lives in breathes tech is probably odd, but physical media is just my favorite. Being in this digital life it just draining and being able to touch, and load up this music is just the best.

Like my car which is absolute opposite to technology, I love love love doing stuff with my hands.
