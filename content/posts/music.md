I am rather fond of music.

I like listening to music on Spotify, however to be honest my favorite way to play music is without a doubt physical media. CD, Vinyl and Cassettes. 

Which for a guy that works in tech and lives in breathes tech is probably odd, but physical media is just my favorite. Being in this digital life it just draining and being able to touch, and physically load up music into a player is just the best.

I only have a very basic setup, but to be honest that's the way I like it. I have a Sony record player, a realistic cassette player (which I'm yet to hookup) and a simple set of bookshelf speakers by edifier. For digital media I have some Sony wf-1000xm3 and some wh-1000xm3, great earphones and headphone can't fault them at all.
